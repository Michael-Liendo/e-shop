# e-commerce

This project is an online store built with Next.js, a JavaScript framework for developing web applications. We use a fake API to get product data and display it in the app by using the fetch() function.

In addition, we implement the Tailwind CSS design framework to give the store an attractive and professional appearance. We also use Zustand to manage the state of the application, allowing easy and efficient management of the shopping cart and other functions.
